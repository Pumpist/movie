== Movie ==

Movie is a Groff macro package for writing screenplays.  It consists
of several macros you can enter on a line by themselves, in between
lines of actual text.  With the exception of .STE, which signifies
the //end// of a subtitle, every macro signifies the start of a block
of text, describing what type of text block it precedes.

If you use the same type of text block several times in a row (such
as .A or .D), subsequent ones can be separated by a blank line.
